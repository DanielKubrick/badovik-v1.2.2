## 🤔 Expected Questions & Responses

### Technical Questions

**"How does this integrate with our existing WooCommerce?"**
> "It's plug-and-play. We use WooCommerce's REST API - no database changes, no disruption to your existing setup. Takes about 15 minutes to configure."

**"What about security?"**
> "Security is paramount. We use HTTPS only, proper API authentication, and follow Telegram's security guidelines. No sensitive data is stored in the frontend."

**"Can this handle high traffic?"**
> "Absolutely. Built on Next.js with WooCommerce's robust backend, it can scale to thousands of concurrent users. We can add CDN and additional optimizations as needed."

### Business Questions

**"What's the ROI on this?"**
> "Mobile conversion rates are typically 2-3x higher than desktop. Plus, by meeting customers where they are - in Telegram - you reduce friction and increase sales."

**"How customizable is this?"**
> "Fully customizable. Colors, branding, payment methods, product displays - everything can be tailored to your brand. We can even white-label it completely."

**"What about support and maintenance?"**
> "We provide full support and regular updates. The codebase is clean, well-documented, and built with maintenance in mind."

### Timeline Questions

**"When can this go live?"**
> "The MVP you see today is production-ready. We can have you live in 1-2 weeks with your branding and configuration."

**"What's the development timeline for additional features?"**
> "We work in 2-week sprints. Each major feature typically takes 1-2 sprints depending on complexity. We can prioritize based on your business needs."
